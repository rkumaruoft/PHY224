Q1: Option 1 is better. In setup one, the ammeter is not reading all of the
current due to resistances in the voltmeter, while the voltmeter is reading all the voltage.
 In setup two, the ammeter is reading all
of the current before the voltmeter reads the terminal
voltage, so the voltmeter value is then measuring less voltage than ideal due to
the ammeters resistance.   If we analyse the terminal voltage formula thus, the
internal resistance is R_int = )V_output-V_terminal) / I, setup 1 will give a
larger internal resistance reading since dividing by the Current in Ohm's law
has a greater change on the output voltage than the the size of the terminal
voltage being subtracted from output voltage. Dividing by a smaller current
gives us a larger resistance. Setup 2 will give us a lower internal resistance
than the theoretical value.


 The ammeter measures the current in series, the
 voltmeter measures the voltage in parallel.


Q2: we had 6 resistors to use: we used five of them, and refrained from using \
the one with the smallest resistance of 100 ohm due to (higher) risk of overheating and
therefore unsteadiness in measuring data.
